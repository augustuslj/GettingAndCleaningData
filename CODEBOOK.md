This is my code book for the tidy_data.txt.

The variables in this data set are subjects (1 to 30) and activities(1 to 6)

The mean and standard deviation were the only calculations done. The grep command was used to focus on these 
two calculations and got rid of everything besides meand and sd.

The three signals that i used to estimate the variables were "-XYZ". XYZ were used to denote signals in all three directions.

The average of both the means and standard deviations for multiple trials for each of these trials where reported in each
row for all combinations of subject and activity type.
